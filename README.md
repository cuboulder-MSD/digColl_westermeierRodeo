# digColl_westermeier_rodeo

Clifford P. Westermeier (1910-1968) and Therese S. Westermeier (1902-1986), both former professors at the University of Colorado Boulder, were prolific collectors on the topics of cowboys, rodeo history, and the American West. This collection contains photographs and photo-postcards related to rodeo history, with particular emphasis on women in rodeo and the Rocky Mountain region. Some material comes from the personal collections of trick riders and rodeo performers Jim Eskew, Florence Randolph, Leonard Stroud, and Mayme Saunders Stroud, which had been obtained by the Westermeiers in the course of their research.
